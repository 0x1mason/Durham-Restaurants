Health Rating Restaurant App
============================

Reasons why we want build an application
----------------------------------------
* An easy win to show city and county commissioners what can be done with open data.
* Demonstrate that having city/county data available and accessible will allow developers to be innovative.
* This is just the start. We're excited to get access to more data sets to help organizations like Durham Cares use this data to help our community.
* Tastiest town of the south. Foody app.

Success metrics
---------------
* Raise average restaurant inspection scores in Durham
* Educate residents about inspections and the process
* Increase awareness of the Durham brigade

City/County role
----------------
* One portal for city/county data
* Create something that's consumable by any platform (JSON, XML, etc.)
* Work with Raleigh/Cary to create common schema

Brigade's role
---------------
* Citizens joining together to improve restaurants
* Help build the application

Data Source
-----------
* Same source that WRAL uses for their restaurant inspections website
    * Excel file uploaded/emailed to WRAL
    * Only summary information, no inspection details or historic data
* Currently in a proprietary, 3rd party application
    * CDP â€“ What does this stand for?
    * Web portal
* Mickey is working to get the data in a better form. In contact with the Director of Environmental Health
* Code should be shared with others on GitHub

Data Next Steps
---------------
* Rather than email WRAL, data could be posted on Durham data portal
* County can host data, not the application
* Update it frequently, once a week at first
    * Real time data later, if possible
    * Work with Raleigh to use a common data schema and field names
* Include latitude/longitude so we don't have to geocode addresses
    * Tax data has every address in Durham

Would people use the app? Is the information in demand?
-------------------------------------------------------
* Eat/don't eat
* Want this to be a win/win for Durham. Don't want to alienate ourselves from owners.
* Provide opportunity for restaurants and owner/staff to use the website
* Use multiple sources and metrics so customer can make a choice
* Aggregated grade. Shifts the blame.

How important is a health rating of a restaurant?
-------------------------------------------------
* Yelp or Tripadvisor sticker
* Restaurants will be proud to distinguish themselves
* All restaurants, including food trucks. Rating is for the kitchen, not the trucks. Trucks have different type of inspection.

Restaurant inspector
--------------------
* What are their thoughts on the matter
* Good/dumb violations

Other data sources/related ideas
--------------------------------
* Who's opening up a new restaurant
* Which restaurants are owned by the same people?
* Where are the food trucks?  

Action Items
------------
* Data: Get our hands on what's available. Just start looking at it so we can think about how to display it:
* Integration: Look at what's available on Yelp, Foursquare, Google, etc.
* People:
    * Find a health inspector to talk to. What questions should we ask?
    * Restaurant owner. What questions should we ask?
